In this lesson, we learned how to use different kind of iluminations, and how to project them into several textures along the environment.
The different kind of iluminations introduced in this program are: 
Directional light -> All the light in the environment.
Point light -> The light produced by a light source.
Spotlight -> the specific point in which the light hits an object.
